     4	% A farmer has with him a fox, a chicken, and a sack of grain.
     5	% He comes to a river and sees a small boat.  He needs to bring
     6	% all three of his things across the river, but the boat is so
     7	% small that only one thing will fit in it with him.  He can not
     8	% leave the fox and the chicken together or the fox will eat the
     9	% chicken.  He can not leave the chicken and the grain together
    10	% or the chicken will eat the grain.  The fox, however, does not
    11	% eat grain.  How should the farmer proceed?
