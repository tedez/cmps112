This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Payton Schwarz (peschwar@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Ted Dersch (tdersch@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair
should drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working
together, and at most 25% of an individual's effort for
an assignment should be spent working alone. Any work done
by a solitary programmer must be reviewed by the partner.
The object is to work together, learning from each other
not to divide the work into two pieces with each partner
working on a different piece.

Payton spent 4 hours working alone.
Ted spent 4 hours working alone.
We spent 14 hours working together.
Payton spent 7 hours driving.
Ted spent 7 hours driving.

The majority of this time was spent smashing our heads
against our desks trying to decipher Smalltalk's 
error messages...
